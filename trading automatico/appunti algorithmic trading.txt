METODOLOGY
Is the strategy momentum based, mean-reverting, market-neutral, directional? 

Does the strategy rely on sophisticated (or complex!) statistical or machine
learning techniques that are hard to understand and require a PhD in statistics to grasp?

Do these techniques introduce a significant quantity of parameters, which might lead to optimisation bias?

Is the strategy likely to withstand a regime change (i.e. potential new regulation of financial markets)?

Evaluate a strategy

In an institutional setting the concept of drawdown is especially important as most hedge
funds are remunerated only when the account equity is continually creating new high water
marks

• Sharpe Ratio
• Leverage - Does the strategy require significant leverage in order to be profitable?
• Frequency/fees
• Volatility 
• Win/Loss, Average Profit/Loss 
• Maximum Drawdown 
• m Parameters
• Benchmark 

• Total Profit/Loss (PnL) - The total PnL straightforwardly states whether a particular
trade has been profitable or not.
• Average Period PnL - The avg. period PnL states whether a bar, on average, generates
a profit or loss.
• Maximum Period Profit - The largest bar-period profit made by this trade so far.
• Maximum Period Loss - The largest bar-period loss made by this trade so far. Note
that this says nothing about future maximum period loss! A future loss could be much
larger than this.
• Average Period Profit - The average over the trade lifetime of all profitable periods.
• Average Period Loss - The average over the trade lifetime of all unprofitable periods.
• Winning Periods - The count of all winning periods.
• Losing Periods - The count of all losing periods.
• Percentage Win/Loss Periods - The percentage of all winning periods to losing periods.
Will differ markedly for trend-following and mean-reverting type strategies.

crontab

might automate the download

It will then automatically run

the aforementioned missing data and spike filtration scripts, alerting the trader via email, SMS
or some other form of notification. At this point any backtesting tools will automatically have
access to recent data, without the trader having to lift a finger!

POSSIBLE DATA FEED ERRORS

Spikes: one must choose the threshold for being told about spikes - how many
standard deviations to use and over what look-back period? Too high a stdev will miss some
spikes
