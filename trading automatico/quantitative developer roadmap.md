QUANTITATIVE DEVELOPER FOR HEDGE FUNDS
For hedge funds, you will likely be implementing trading infrastructure - either low or high frequency. This will involve taking an algorithm already coded up in MatLab, R or Python (or even C++) and then optimising it in a faster language, such as C++, as well as hooking up this algorithm to a prime brokerage application programming interface (API) and executing trades. The skills required here are quite disparate. You will need to be able to pull together data from various sources, put it into the correct context, iterate over it rapidly and then generate on-demand reports either in fixed-format (PDF), over the web or as an API itself. These skills are hard to learn from books directly and require a few years of software development experience in the technology industry.


Financial Models in Practice: Letâ€™s look into what are the most familiar mathematical and statistical models that are being deployed on quantitative development. 

 

    Sum of the Parts Model: This model is computed by taking multiple discounted cash flow models and adding them finally.
    Consolidation Model: Here multiple business units are consolidated to one model.
    Budget Model: Focusing the income stream the budget models are framed.
    Forecasting Model: Predicting the future expense with the financial planning and analysis.
    Option Pricing Model: This is a straight mathematical model based on the binomial tree and Black-Scholes.
    Three Statement Model: The three important financial statements income statement, balance sheet statement, cash flow statement is formulated in Excel macros.
    Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Model: This is computed along with three primary statements along with net present value and future values.
    Merger Model (M&A): This is the merger and acquisition model computed with the consolidation of primary states of merging companies.
    Initial Public Offering (IPO) Model: With a thorough company analysis the IPO models are constructed.
    Leveraged Buyout (LBO) Model: Based on debt schedules this model is constructed.
    
    
    As a quantitative developer, you would be needing to develop and maintain the quant models for several functions at the investment bank or financial services institutions. These functions are pricing, risk management as well as analysis. To develop such skills and for creating these models, you will need strong knowledge in the statistical and mathematical domain. Some of these models which are deployed for quantitative development are:

    Consolidation model
    Option pricing model
    Forecasting model
    Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model
    Merger model


Consolidation model

	This model helps with consolidation of multiple business units into one model
	Option pricing model

	This model is on the basis of theories like Black-Scholes and binomial tree in trading
	Forecasting model

	This model helps to forecast the pattern of a stock and make right decisions with regard to investing in the stock market
	Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model

	This model happens to be important for calculating net present value and future values in the market
	Merger model

	Also known as merger and acquisition model, it is computed with the primary merging companies
