1: vertical scaling: optimise precision and increase through put with the same resources 
2: preprossing (e.g cron job) : prepare before hand during non pick hours 
3: Backups: keep backups and avoid single point of failure 
4: horizontal scaling: get more resources 
5: micro service architecture 
6: distributed system (partioning)
7: load distribution 
8: Decoupling 
9: Logging 
10: extensible
