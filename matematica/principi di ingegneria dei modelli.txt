The Modelers’ Hippocratic Oath
• I will remember that I didn’t make the world, and it
doesn’t satisfy my equations.

•Though I will use models boldly to estimate value, I
will not be overly impressed by mathematics.

• I will never sacrifice reality for elegance without
explaining why I have done so.

•Nor will I give the people who use my model false
comfort about its accuracy. Instead, I will make
explicit its assumptions and oversights.

• I understand that my work may have enormous
effects on society and the economy, many of them
beyond my comprehension.
